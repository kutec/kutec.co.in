Once you have learned the basics of React, the next thing is the Hooks. Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8 and they are the most common set of snippets that you would use in any project.

Hooks help writting stateful logic and hence the code becomes reusable and indepe from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. **Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.** This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.
