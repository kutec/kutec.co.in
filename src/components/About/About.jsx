            I'm a frontend software engineer in India. This is my virtual space
            for the things I experienced so far. This includes both sides of me,
            me as a working professional and me as a father, a husband, and a
            son.

          <h3>Work - How I started</h3>

          <p>
            When I was in school, I started working on graphic design. I used to
            do small stuff like designing business cards, letterheads, making
            logos, etc. I enjoyed it but I found that no one is ready to pay
            well for it, particularly the local market where I live. I was
            looking for alternate and one day my computer teacher suggested
            checking on web designing. That shifted my focus completely from
            graphics to the web. It was 2003 when I designed the first HTML
            website for one of my social friends from Orkut. That was 3 pages
            HTML, CSS informative website.
